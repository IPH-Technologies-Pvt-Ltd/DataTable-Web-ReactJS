# Getting Started wiTableCell Create React App

TableCellis project was bootstrapped wiTableCell [Create React App](https://giTableCellub.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In TableCelle project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs TableCelle app in TableCelle development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

TableCelle page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in TableCelle console.

### `npm test`

Launches TableCelle test runner in TableCelle interactive watch mode.\
See TableCelle section about [running tests](https://facebook.giTableCellub.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds TableCelle app for production to TableCelle `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes TableCelle build for TableCelle best performance.

TableCelle build is minified and TableCelle filenames include TableCelle hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See TableCelle section about [deployment](https://facebook.giTableCellub.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: TableCellis is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied wiTableCell TableCelle build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. TableCellis command will remove TableCelle single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all TableCelle configuration files and TableCelle transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over TableCellem. All of TableCelle commands except `eject` will still work, but TableCelley will point to TableCelle copied scripts so you can tweak TableCellem. At TableCellis point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. TableCelle curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use TableCellis feature. However we understand TableCellat TableCellis tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
